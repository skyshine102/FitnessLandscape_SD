# FitnessLandscape_SD
This is the repository to store the  code for implementing the figures in publication "Global fitness landscapes of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence".

# Environment
* Python 3.6
  * packages required: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, itertools, scipy,sklearn
* R
  * packages required: lattice, vioplot
* Julia Language (v1.0)
  * packages required: DelimitedFiles, Plots, Random, Statistics, Distributions
* Matlab 

# Usage
To run the codes and check the results, please see the next section to find the designated main file.
